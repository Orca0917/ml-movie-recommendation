# Movie Rating Prediction
### üëãüèª Introduction
This code aims to predict movie ratings based on various features using different regression models. The dataset used contains information about movies, such as genre, budget, and runtime.

<br/>

### ‚úÖ Getting Started
First, please prepare Movielens dataset. The method currently learned uses 'ml-latest-small.zip' data from the movielens dataset. Other data are also available, and depending on the data used, there may be variations in learning time.

- Discuss the advantages and limitations of the XGBoost model.

### Gradient Boosting Regression
- Train a gradient boosting regression model using the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and calculate the RMSE.
- Plot the feature importance rankings and discuss the significance of each feature.

### LightGBM Regression
- Train a LightGBM regression model using the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and calculate the RMSE.
- Compare the results with previous models and highlight any differences or improvements.

### AdaBoost Regression
- Train an AdaBoost regression model using the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and calculate the RMSE.
- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the AdaBoost model.

## Results and Conclusion
